# If Elon Tweets Then Bot Buys Dogecoin

## DESCRIPTION

This bot is designed to buy Dogecoin every time Elon musk tweets about Dogecoin with the following parameters:

The bot will open a buy position on Dogecoin every time Elon mentions Dogecoin in his tweet
Take profit is set to 10% and stop loss to 5%
The Dogecoin bot will not place another trade if there is already an active trade (can be adjusted) 

The bot uses the Tweepy API and a Twitter developer account that you will need access to, as well as a MetaTrader 5 account.

## USE CASES

This particular project is mainly built for fun and the novelty of it. It has just been developed, so has yet to be tested on a live account. Thus, there isn't any details analysis to suggest return rate profits as of date.

Keeping script open-source. If you'd like to collaborate, get in touch.
